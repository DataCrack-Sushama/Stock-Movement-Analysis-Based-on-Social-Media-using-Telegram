01. Cautious on USA
02. Bearish on USA Banks. Sold all positions except BOA due to his relationship and commitments made. Hates Banks having Investment Banks as they land up taking exotic/derivatives positions. Insurance business will do well.
03. Frequent Management churn affects business.
04. AI will be more for documentation, etc. but risk calls will still be human. AI can’t replace *Ajit Jain*! Plenty of opportunities, so tech won’t make much difference but too much easy money chasing, hence opportunities overpriced.
05. Value investors should expect less returns now.

06. Too much easy money still chasing ideas, hence dumb investments will continue.
07. Bearish on ESG, waste of time. Charlie very bullish on Hydrocarbons.
08. Commercial real estate in big trouble, banks will be impacted.
09. World is overwhelmingly short term focused. Management is feeding infomation on how will they beat expectations is very short term.
10. Doesn't select managers based on where they got their degrees from. Can tell in 10 seconds whether they are interested in a business based on how consumers feel about it and what threats it might face. Hired Ajit Jain the Insurance Business Head at Berkshire, as his # 2, even though Jain didn't know much about the insurance business.

11. Formula for success: a) Spend less than you earn, b) Avoid toxicity, c) Practise deferred gratification.
12. On streaming wars: You either need fewer companies or higher prices.
13. You don't want to go into a game where you need that much luck. We are different from Elon Musk who attempts the impossible. Looking for an easy job that we can identify.
14. Auto industry is ruthless and totally unpredictable. Even Henry Ford started losing money within 20 years of releasing Model T.

Lankans voted for Rajapakshas knowing very well what they did in the past, including corruption, selling out national assets to China, dynastic politics and all.

They still voted for them because Rajapakshas promised things they could not refuse.

1. Their GST, called VAT Tax, on all products was reduced to 8%, thus making everything cheaper in one stroke. (It  also killed the govt revenue). People loved things getting cheaper.

2. The minimum Income Tax threshold was changed from 5 Lakhs per annum to 30 Lakhs! Very few earned more than 30L!
A very large part of the population became tax exempt. This was very popular among the salaried class.

3. For those with income over 30 Lakhs,  the upper ceiling of maximum personal tax of 15% was created, so no one paid over 15% tax. For comparison, it is around 42% in India and between 40 to 60% in many developed countries.

4. Corporate tax was promised to be reduced to 14%!
Every corporate supported and funded Rajapakshas.

5. They abolished seven other taxes, including a 2% nation building tax paid by businesses.

6. Zero tax for many industries like IT services and hotels that serve tourists etc.

7. Various taxes imposed on religious institutions were promised to be scrapped. Srilanka's powerful Buddhist Monks campaigned during election times to vote for Rajpakshas.

8. Individuals and companies engaged in  agriculture, fisheries and livestock farming were exempted from any taxes for the next 5 years.

9. The daily minimum wages of tea workers were raised to Rs.1000. Instantly got all their votes.

10. Minimum salary for private company employees was fixed at Rs12500 per month. Every low income family loved it.

11. Tax on retirement gratuity was reduced from 24% to 15%. All senior citizens loved it.

12. Pensions were awarded to state bank employees who were not eligible. Those employees loved it.

13. 15% VAT on apartments was scrapped. Young home buyers and construction industry loved it.

14. Fuel prices were kept artificially low. They bought Petrol from India, and still sold it at prices lower than India. No tax revenue there either.

15. In a hurry to make Srilanka a developed nation, they went on an infrastructure building spree financed by Chinese loans. Infrastructure that they could not use for productivity. Those projects became white elephants. 

Rajapakshas delivered on these promises promptly as soon as they got into office. They bankrupted the country in the process.

In trying to get so many things for free, Sri Lankans actually ended up paying much higher prices.

❌Now, Srilankan rupee trades for Rs 310 per dollar. For an import-dependent country, this means everyone's savings got reduced by the same ratio. Their buying power decreased. Their salary did not increase in proportion to the inflation. Thus everyone actually ended up with smaller incomes.

❌❌Besides monetary issues, it destroyed the country, has caused lot of human suffering with 15 hour powercuts, lack of food, civil war and political instability....

(Long term capital gains/loss = For  holding period more than 1 year

Short term capital gains/loss = For holding period less than 1 year)

-  1 lakh profit in a Financial year is exempt as Long term capital gains. So book profits in shares & mutual funds together upto 1 lakh, and reinvest 

- If profits are more than 1 lakh, check if you can book loss in any of the holdings to set off. You can buy back the next day

- Short term capital gains are taxed at 15%, book losses and buy back next day to set off any profits. 

- Both Long and short term losses can be carried forward for 8 years. So booking losses can help save future taxes. ( Make sure you file IT returns on time)

- LTC losses can be set off against LTCG only. STC losses can be set off against ST and LT capital gains

- Futures & Options profit /loss will be taxed along with normal tax slab"

Putin is going to hit once, but he's going to hit hard. Russia is preparing the release of evidence of the involvement of the US government and intelligence services in the September 11 attacks. The list of evidence includes satellite images.

Published material can prove the US government complicity in the 9/11 attacks and the successful manipulation of public opinion. The attack was planned by the US government, but exercised using  her proxy, so that an attack on America and the people of the United States looked like an act of aggression by international terrorist organizations.

The motive for deception and murder its own citizens served  US oil interests and the Middle East state corporations. The evidence will be so convincing that it utterly debunks the official 9/11 cover story supported by the US government.

Russia proves that America is no stranger to using false flag terrorism against its citizens in order to achieve a pretext for military intervention in a foreign country. In the case of ""the September 11 attacks,"" the evidence will be conclusive satellite imagery.

If successful, the consequences of Putin's tactics would expose the US government's secret terrorist policies. The government's credibility will be undermined and should bring about mass protests in the cities leading to an uprising, according to American analysts..

And as the United States will look on the world political arena? The validity of America's position as a leader in the fight against international terrorism will be totally undermined  giving immediately advantage to rogue states and Islamic terrorists.

An initial public offering (IPO) allows a firm to raise funds from the general public. The move from a private to a public firm, which often involves a share premium for current private investors, can be a crucial opportunity for private investors to completely realise rewards from their investment. Meanwhile, public investors are allowed to participate in the offering.

2021-10-03 06:15:25+00:00,,"Peter Lynch: 20 Investing Golden Rules

1. You have to know what you own, and why you own it. Never invest in a company without understanding its finances.

2. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets. Always look at the balance sheet to see if a company is solvent.

3. Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and stock mutual funds altogether.

4. Your investor's edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It's something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.

5. Over the past 3 decades, the stock market has come to be dominated by a herd of professional investors. Contrary to popular belief, this makes it easier for the amateur investor. You beat the market by ignoring the herd.

6. There is no correlation between success of a company's operations and the success of its stock over a few years. In the long term, there is 100% correlation between the success of the company and the success of the stock.

7. Long shots almost always miss the mark.

8. Owning stock is like having children - don't get involved with more than you can handle. There don't have to be more than five companies in the portfolio at any one time.

9. If you can't find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money in the bank until you discover some.

10. Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets.

11. Avoid hot stocks in hot companies. Great companies in cold, non-growth industries are consistent big winners.

12. With small companies, you're better off to wait until they turn a profit before you invest.

13. If you invest $1,000 in a stock, all you can lose is $1,000, but you stand to gain $10,000 or even $50,000 over the time you're patient. You need to find a few good stocks to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile.

14. In every industry and every region, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.

15. A stock-market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you're prepared, it can't hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic.

16. There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of newscasters. Sell a stock because the company's fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.

17. Nobody can predict the interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what's actually happening to the companies in which you've invested.

18. If you study 10 companies, you'll find one for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you'll find five. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market.

19. If you don't study any companies you have the same chance of success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards.

20. Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies.

The highest bull markets in any nation happens when the economy moves from 2 Trillions to 5 Trillions. There are 3 nations who have done it:

- China took 5 Years to go from 2 Trillions to 5 Trillions (2004-2009)
During this time the Hangsang went from 8500 to 32000 – Gain of 4 times.

- USA took 11 years to go from 2 Trillions to 5 Trillions (1977-1988)
The Dow Jones between 1977 to 2000 went from 700 levels to 12000 – Gain of 15 times.

- Japan took 8.5 years to go from 2 Trillions to 5 Trillions (1978-1986)
The Japanese stock market between 1978-1991 went from 2000 to 37000 - Gain of 14 times.

So Historically the mother of all Bull Markets in any nation starts between 2 Trillions to 5 Trillions!

India and the Indian Economy is just getting started.

SEBI margin rules explain in layman’s language. SEBI has changed some rules related to margin and trading. 

1) Buying and selling of shares will Require Upfront Margin from now onwards.

Eg: If you want to buy Reliance shares worth 1lakh, you must have 20k Rs in your account as cash and the rest money to be paid within 2 days...

👆🏻 Major Change If you want to sell 1 lac worth of Reliance shares from your holdings for that scenario also you must have min 20k rs in your account. Failing which penalties will be levied.

👆🏻 Read Carefully... Selling from holding will also require Upfront margin in cash (Var+ELM).

You can keep extra cash or can pledge other holdings for the stipulated margin required.

2) Shares bought today cannot be sold Tomorrow. 

Implications:  BTST Closed

Eg You bought Reliance On Monday. You can only sell those shares after receiving the delivery of shares. T+2 you can sell on Wednesday.

You can only sell the shares after you receive in Your DP/only after receiving the delivery of shares.

3) Shares Sold Today from delivery..... the funds cannot be used for new trades today. You can use the funds for new trades the next day.

Eg:🌟 You sold 100,000 Rs worth of Reliance's shares today. 
👆🏻You cannot use this money to buy fresh shares of other companies.

Some of my friends always ask me why I always dig into the fundamentals of any stock before  investing. 
According to their logic, if one can earn 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x returns in a short period of time, why should one wait for a longer period of 5 to 10 years.

Here I have a story for them.


*THE STORY OF PUPPY 🐶 WEALTH OR ELEPHANT 🐘 WEALTH:?*

An elephant and a dog became pregnant at the same time. Three months down the line the dog gave birth to six puppies.

Six months later the dog was pregnant again, and nine months on it gave birth to another dozen puppies.

The pattern continued.

On the eighteenth month, the dog approached the elephant questioning, _”Are you sure that you are pregnant?

We became pregnant on the same date, I have given birth three times to a dozen puppies and they are now grown to become big dogs, yet you are still pregnant. What’s going on?”

The elephant replied, _”There is something I want you to understand. What I am carrying is not a puppy but an elephant.

I give birth to only one in two years. When my baby hits the ground, the earth feels it. When my baby crosses the road, human beings stop and watch in admiration, what I carry draws attention.

So what I’m carrying is mighty and great.”

Likewise, if you break your Equity Investments in one or two years, you will get puppy wealth and if you keep your Good Quality Equity Portfolio for 10 to 15 years you make elephant wealth.

Think before you sell your Quality Portfolio Equity Investments mid way.

You want to settle for puppy wealth that lives for 7 to 8 years or do you want elephant wealth that will stay for 100 years.

Be a good saver. Become a better investor. 

Happy Investing!

These pending orders act as support against a severe sell-off. Due to exchange goof up, many people missed to notice that, pending orders were cancelled automatically.

In such situation, a quick large sell order can push prices very very down due to no buy pending orders. Stoploss and limit buy are still buy orders that push prices up.

*_Pfizer on November 9 claimed that its vaccine data suggests the shots may be 90 percent effective at preventing the pandemic._*

While the global COVID-19 tally has crossed 50 million and fatalities hit 1.2 million, American multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer on November 9 claimed that its vaccine data suggests that the shots may be 90 percent effective at preventing the pandemic.

Following the reports of a 90 percent successful vaccine trial by Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Dr Albert Bourla released a statement.

*Dr Albert Bourla's full statement:*

_Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19._

We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.

With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.

I want to thank the thousands of people who volunteered to participate in the clinical trial, our academic collaborators and investigators at the study sites, and our colleagues and collaborators around the world who are dedicating their time to this crucial endeavor.

We could not have come this far without the tremendous commitment of everyone involved.

The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort.

When we embarked on this journey 10 months ago this is what we aspired to achieve. Especially today, while we are all in the midst of a second wave and many of us in lockdown, we appreciate even more how important this milestone is on our path towards ending this pandemic and for all of us to regain a sense of normality.

We will continue to collect further data as the trial continues to enroll for a final analysis planned when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this important achievement possible."""

💸Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) by the RBI allows a resident individual to remit a certain sum of money ($250,000) in a financial year to another country for investments and expenditure.

💸An individual can remit money under LRS for the following purposes:

1️⃣Investments in equity, debt instruments abroad
2️⃣Travel
3️⃣Medical Treatment
4️⃣Studies Abroad
5️⃣Gifts
6️⃣Donations
7️⃣Maintenance of close relatives
🆕As per the Finance Act of 2020, funds sent abroad under LRS is subject to 5% Tax Collected at Source (TCS) with effect from October 1st, 2020

*Rate at which TCS is levied*
TCS will be levied at 5% for foreign remittance amount in excess of ₹7,00,000 in a financial year.

👉For example, a foreign remittance of ₹8,00,000 is subject to 5% TCS only on the balance ₹1,00,000 (ie. amount exceeding ₹7 lakh). In this case, the TCS would amount to 5% of Rs 1 lakh or ₹5,000.

*Calculations for Current Financial Year*
Any remittance made before 1st October, 2020 is not subjected to TCS, i.e. no retrospective deduction of tax.
However, any remittances made on or after 1st April, 2020 will be included while counting the overall ₹7 Lakh exemption.
If ₹6,00,000 is remitted before 1st October, 2020, no TCS will be levied.
If an additional ₹4,00,000 is remitted on or after 1st October, 2020, then 5% TCS will be levied on: ₹10,00,000 (total amount remitted in FY) minus ₹7,00,000 (exemption), i.e. ₹3,00,000. Therefore, TCS collection will be equal to 5% of ₹3,00,000, i.e. ₹15,000

*Exclusions from the new rule*
5% TCS and ₹7 Lakh exemption is applicable on all foreign remittances except the below transactions:

1️⃣Payment towards education loan for foreign education subject to a lower 0.5%
TCS will also not apply if you are subject to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
2️⃣If the PAN is not furnished at the time of remittance then TCS will be levied at the rate of 10% instead of 5%
3️⃣TCS on remittances for the purpose of overseas travel tour package will be levied on the whole amount and no ₹7 Lakh exemption to be applicable

🤷‍♀️Who is impacted?
Indian investors investing in equity, debt or property abroad
Indian students studying abroad
Indian tourists going abroad

*The TCS paid may be used as a credit against final tax payable on income earned by you in the tax return*"

1. India has overtaken Taiwan to become the #fourth largest forex reserve holder in the world. Reserve build-up of in Q1 FY21 ($27bn) was almost equally split between RBI’s dollar buying and MTM valuation gains.

2. In Q2 FY21, rise in forex reserves ($36bn so far) is being driven mainly by RBI’s #forex
buying. This is averting large rupee appreciation and also keeping domestic liquidity accommodative.

3.  Forex reserve build-up in last 12 months has been $113 billion.

4. Record high forex reserves coupled with the high cost of reserve holding may slow
down further accumulation.

5. RBI’s forex interventions are stalling sharp rupee appreciation and injecting large rupee liquidity in the system. With the likely scaling down of RBI’s intervention, liquidity infusion through this route is likely to reduce.

6. Asian countries are maintaining larger forex reserves vs. countries from other continents. Out of the top 10 forex reserve holding countries of the world, 7 are from Asia.

7. The bid to avoid currency appreciation (in view of dollar weakness) seem to be a major reason for forex reserve build-up."

1. Minor Demat account could be operated by Guardian i.e Father/Mother or any person who appointed by legal entity(Court).

2. You should submit 2 KYC forms to Broker at the time of Account opening i.e:

a) Guardian KYC details

b) Minor KYC details

3. Once Minor become Major You should close the Minor Demat account and open Normal Demat account.

4. In Minor account You can do only Equity delivery Trades.

5. Equity Intraday, Equity Derivative(FNO) Trading and Currency Derivative trading in Minor account is not possible to trade.

6. Minor can’t become Joint Holder in a Demat account.

7. “Any Contracts against Minor can be voidable” Perhaps Most of the Brokers in India will not prefer to Open Minor Trading and Demat account.

Minor account cannot be operated in the “Secondary account”

Minor account is eligible only for “primary market”

So basically this means:
You wont have a trading account mapped to the Demat Account of the minor, Which means no access to Trading platform which is used to place buy & sell orders

The only way to sell shares is by doing a off market share transfer from Minor Demat account to your Demat account

New shares cannot be bought for a particular stock."

2020-08-30 11:43:32+00:00,,"Warren Buffett turns 90 on August 30.
A super successful investor and generous philanthropists, Buffett, has a legacy that cannot be matched by anyone ordinary.
He first bought a stock at the age of 11 and first filed taxes at the age of 13. At present, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway's net worth is more than $82 billion.

Buffett's acumen to understand the trends of markets is no less than extraordinary. Every year, when he addresses the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, he doles out the pearls of wisdom that he has acquired after decades of experience.
The current market situation is fairly similar to what the US equity market was in 1958 when investing in the market acquired significant momentum.
In his letter to partners in 1959, Buffett wrote that almost any reason was seized upon to justify investing in the market at that time.
With the new-age Robinhood traders cropping up in the market, a similar scenario is visible.
Also read: Robinhood fever grips Indian stock market as hordes of first-time investors bet on share trading
Buffett has always cautioned about being too greedy in the market.
In his same letter in 1959, Buffett wrote, ""I do believe that widespread public belief in the inevitability of profits from investment in stocks will lead to eventual trouble. Should this occur, prices, but not intrinsic values in my opinion, of even undervalued securities, can be expected to be substantially affected.""
""There are undoubtedly more mercurial-tempered people in the stock market now than a for a good many years and the duration of their stay will be limited to how long they think profits can be made quickly and effortlessly.""
""While it is impossible to determine how long they will continue to add numbers to their ranks and thereby stimulate rising prices. I believe it is valid to say that the longer their visit, the greater the reaction from it.""
Buffet clearly hinted that the market was not able to sustain the greed and irrational attitude of investors which remains a fact for always.
Buffett also mentioned in the letter his love for undervalued stocks.
""I make no attempt to forecast the general market - my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities,"" Buffett had written.
But Buffett mentioned - higher the level of the market, fewer the undervalued occur.
In the last paragraph of that letter, Buffett underscored his time-tested winning formula of picking undervalued stocks that give an above-average performance in a bear market or natural market, and normal performance in a bull market.
Buffett's enormous wealth cannot be seen as the biggest achievement of his life. Buffett's biggest achievement, perhaps, is the legacy that he has created.
His words of wisdom, his sharp acumen to understand the emerging trends and his ability to touch lives by the act of philanthropy make him a role model for humanity.
As per Forbes, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.
He has promised to donate over 99 percent of his wealth. So far, as per Forbes, he has given more than $41 billion away.
What a worth-emulating journey!
He had said once, ""I measure success by how many people love me."" Many, undoubtedly, admire him and will keep doing so.
Happy birthday, Oracle of Omaha!

2020-08-25 07:31:17+00:00,,"*RBI's annual report: Moratorium, loan restructuring may impact banks’ health.*
_Beginning March, the RBI had announced several measures to help the Covid-hit economy. This include a six months moratorium on loans and a one-time loan restructuring of loans impacted by Covid._

Regulatory dispensations that the pandemic has necessitated in terms of the moratorium on loan instalments, deferment of interest payments and restructuring may have implications for the financial health of banks, unless they are closely monitored and judiciously used, the RBI said in its annual report today.

“Although gross and net non-performing asset ratios had come down in March 2020 along with receding slippage ratios, the economic fallout of the pandemic is likely to test this resilience, especially since the regulatory accommodations announced in the wake of the outbreak have masked the consequent build-up of stress,” said the RBI in its 2019-20 annual report today.

Beginning March, the RBI had announced several measures to help the COVID-19-hit economy. This include a six months moratorium on loans and a one-time loan restructuring of loans impacted by COVID-19. These measures have averted a big spike in NPAs (non performing assets) for now.

The RBI, citing the macro stress tests reported in the July 2020 Financial Stability Report, said the NPAs may surge 1.5 times above their March 2020 levels under the baseline scenario and by 1.7 times in a very severely stressed scenario. The system level CRAR can drop to 13.3 per cent in March 2021 from its March 2020 level under the baseline scenario and to 11.8 per cent under the very severe stress scenario, the RBI said.

*Bank recapitalisation key*
In the backdrop of likely asset quality pressures on Indian banks, recapitalisation of public sector banks is key, the RBI said.
“Recapitalisation plan for public and private sector banks assumes
critical importance. The minimum capital requirements, which are calibrated on the basis of historical loss events, may no longer suffice to absorb post-pandemic losses,” the RBI said.

Recently, the Reserve Bank has already advised banks and NBFCs to carry out COVID-19 stress tests and take necessary remedial measures proactively.

“The ability to raise capital as well as build resilience to ensure financial stability in anticipation of more frequent, varied and bigger risk events than in the past shall be contingent on the governance standards in banks, particularly on strength of risk governance framework,” the RBI said.RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das had recently asked banks to prepare for the Covid shock by enhancing their capital strength. A series of banks had recently raised capital from the market to guard against the bad loan shock."

To see the DOW drop drown 700-800 points in the morning, what’s your reaction when you see something like that?

Category: Market

1. I like to buy stocks so I consider it an opportunity 

2. I don’t know how many 3% declines I’ve had in my lifetime but there have been a lot of them. And I can’t think of one that you shouldn’t have bought on.

3. We certainly won’t be selling. And yeah, we could easily be buying something.

4. If you like to own American businesses, you’re getting a chance to buy it 3% cheaper. I don’t consider that a lot cheaper. I mean, but how can it be bad news unless you have to sell stocks?

5. Somebody can come around and offer you a quote on your house today. And it could be 2% less than they offered you yesterday. But if you like the house it really doesn’t make any difference to you."

2020-08-16 07:45:07+00:00,,"*☣️Hats off to Justice Mishra's observation on AGR hearing at SC.*

A spectrum is a Soverign Resource and Govt has the right over it any time.

Why not JIO pay the AGR dues of Rs.31000 crs of RCOM.

The Spectrum moved from RIL subsidiary to RCOM DURING Sibling Asset settlement in 2006 and found it's way back to RIL Subsidiary in 2016.

The movement is so beautifully schemed so that AGR payable to the Government becomes non payable in the entire process of spectrum usage till  2016 due to dispute in AGR calculation.

 This was achieved by ensuring RCOM becomes insolvent so that AGR due are  irrecoverable.

The investors of RCOM fell flat in the process of  shift of spectrum  resource usage.

Oil was struggling to keep cash registers tinkling and Data replaces OIL to maintain the  cash flow of RIL.

Any product where the end price is under Govt control will result in ultimate death of that organisation.  This is the history of India.

The foundation of SC judgement cannot be different based on a company existence or  non existence. 

We will write off the AGR from insolvent companies and collect AGR from companies in operation is not all acceptable.

VIL,BSNL,and Bharti had built the 2G and 3 G infrastructure by investing heavily on Spectrum and connectivity. They upgraded to 4G but still served the poor of the country who used 2G and 3G platform.

RIL in 2016 started  using the spectrum of RCOM for meeting their needs of 2G and 3G customers. 

JIO offered Voice as free as a marketing tool to woo the customers of other players in the market. 40 cr people migrated or added a second cell to reduce their expenses.

In the process all existing companies started to bleed since their revenue realisation for their customer dropped by 50%.

The sky was falling and earth was going up for these old players of definite future AGR liability and Low Revenue Realisation from its customers.

When we buy any property the first thing we verify is on the property Encumbarance. If it is there the ultimate buyer did not get the 100% ownership.

In this case also the spectrum of RCOM had an encumbarance of AGR dues and it is height of stupidity that DOT allowed transfer of Spectrum Usage to RIL without fixing in dues settlement. 

RCOM also applied for Insolvency after an incubation period of 4 years for RIL to complete its foundation of JIO.

Any definition of operational or financial creditors cannot include the Soverign body THE GOVT OF INDIA at par with them.

The Sovereign body must have a precedence of claim over Spectrum since it is like a heart in a human body. 

JIO kept an artificial heart at RCOM and transplanted the original heart called Spectrum for RIL  Cash pumping  Blood.

The business model of other players were destroyed in the process and it is leading to a virtual JIO Monopoly in Telecom sector.

 This is 100% against the people of India.

*Justice Mishra is 100% correct in demanding RCOM spectrum dues of Rs.31000 crs from JIO*"

You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.”

: RBI GOV DAS: WILL REFLECT ON SOME DYNAMIC SHIFTS IN INDIAN ECONOMY.."
2020-07-26 21:17:29+00:00,,"14) This rally in world markets is mainly due to liquidity, As the bond buying by fed and European world banks end, liquidity will dry up around the globe leading to huge world market crash globally .

15) Around 400 million Job losses are estimated in the world due to covid 19, some predictions even go to 650 million Job losses.

16) INDIAN GDP HAD FELL TO 4.5 PERCENT EVEN BEFORE CORONA STARTED SPREADING. 

17) It is highly feared that second wave of CORONA will be even dangerous than the first wave.

18) IT is feared that China has bought WHO, so world is not trusting WHO anymore, even USA stopped providing aids to WHO.

19) Situation in Hong kong is out of control, Protests are not stopping in Hong kong.

20)  Developed and major  economies of the world such as European region, America, Great Britain, Japan, Saudi Arabia, China, Dubai ,Russia ,south korea ,Taiwan ,Hong long ,Australia ,new Zealand ,Brazil ,mexico etc are starring at longer recessions.

Note- we are facing the biggest downturn of the century due to covid 19, when the liquidity gush ends in world markets which is expected to end soon, we could be looking at biggest stock market crash of the last 2 decades.
Please be cautious. Do not leverage for buying stocks. Do not get aggressive in buying stocks in the bad times of covid 19. Global economy is still in lockdown mode. Growth will take a long long time to come back."
2020-07-26 21:17:28+00:00,,"Forwarded as received.

The biggest stock market crash could be coming, want to know the reasons, read them below, and yes please read the full information. Just read 20 points mentioned below:

It will take 5 minutes of your time But could save big money.

1) RBI has said there is disconnect between real economy and stock markets, what it means is that economy is weak and stock market is still rising means its a bubble in making which will burst soon.

2) RBI’s Financial stability report has warned that there would be rise in defaults. What it means in simple words  that many small and big businessmen’s wont be able to pay their loans back to the back and even many big industrialists could fail in paying the loans back to the bank ,even Some people who lost their Jobs due to covid 19 will be unable to pay their loans back .This could be the biggest trouble Indian banking system has ever faced .

3) The cases of corona are rising all over the world and the pandemic is not ready to stop and is still spreading at a great speed, it has completely halted the world economy. In simple word it means that world economy is even in bigger depression than ever.

4) Some central banks in world have already mentioned that as the pandemic ends they will stop providing interest at lower rates which they are providing now due to corona, This will suck out the liquidity which is available now and stock markets will crash so badly that people will not be able to even exit their positions and will be facing huge losses.

5) Specially in India where the economy is in problem and facing slowdown since last three years due to bad implication of GST, demonetisation and Taxes like LTCG On stock markets, There could be huge rise in bad loans.

6) Economists are Forecasting That gross domestic production can shrink between  5 to  10 percent which is a very bad sign for Indian economy.

7) If one carefully studies the data of this rise, most mutual funds, FII’s  and star investors are exiting mid caps and small caps in this rally which means even FII’s  and mutual funds and smart investors know that this is not a real bull market rally but a bear market rally which will end soon trapping lots of investors on the buying side.

8) Most of The rally in Indian stock market is due to Reliance industries and not many large caps, mid caps and small caps are participating in this rally clearly indicating that there is not much buying interest in other stocks. More than 50 to 60 percent of rally in Indian stock market is fuelled by Reliance, the day Reliance starts correcting no sector will be there to support Indian markets .

9) On whatsApp there are thousands of messages going around to buy mid caps and small caps. On youtube one can find thousands of videos predicting multibaggers, sms are roaming around like wildfire to buy stocks, lots of traders and investors have started betting on small caps and mid caps on basis of this kind of recommendations on whats app, Youtube and twitter .

10) Around 1.2 million new demat accounts have been opened since lockdown. This means that people who are free due to job losses or business shutting down have started betting or investing in stock markets. This kind of new investors may be going for short term money or quick money and may be investing in mid caps or small caps.

11) Even IMF has warned about the on going rally in the world markets, it simply means that this rally in world markets is a big big bubble which will burst in a bad way.

12) Auto and auto ancillary industry is in   bad shape in india since last 3 to 4 years showing no signs of recovery and no recovery is expected even in next 3 to 4 years .

13) Trade war between USA AND CHINA is escalating ,this is the new cold war of our times and the most dangerous one ,this cold war between America and china will keep the world growth engine slow and very slow."

2020-07-22 05:44:53+00:00,,"If you don’t know who you are, the markets are an expensive place to find out.
46. In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word – Nobody! Thus the successful trader does not base moves on what supposedly will happen but reacts instead to what does happen.
47. Except in unusual circumstances, get in the habit of taking your profit too soon. Don’t torment yourself if a trade continues winning without you. Chances are it won’t continue long. If it does, console yourself by thinking of all the times when liquidating early reserved gains that you would have otherwise lost.
48. When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray – jump!
49. Lose your opinion – not your money.
50. Assimilate into your very bones a set of trading rules that works for you."
2020-07-22 05:44:53+00:00,,"50 Time Tested Classic Stock Trading Rules

1. Plan your trades. Trade your plan.
2. Keep records of your trading results.
3. Keep a positive attitude, no matter how much you lose.
4. Don’t take the market home.
5. Continually set higher trading goals.
6. Successful traders buy into bad news and sell into good news.
7. Successful traders are not afraid to buy high and sell low.
8. Successful traders have a well-scheduled planned time for studying the markets.
9. Successful traders isolate themselves from the opinions of others.
10. Continually strive for patience, perseverance, determination, and rational action.
11. Limit your losses – use stops!
12. Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it!
13. Place the stop at the time you make your trade.
14. Never get into the market because you are anxious because of waiting.
15. Avoid getting in or out of the market too often.
16. Losses make the trader studious – not profits. Take advantage of every loss to improve your knowledge of market action.
17. The most difficult task in speculation is not prediction but self-control. Successful trading is difficult and frustrating. You are the most important element in the equation for success.
18. Always discipline yourself by following a pre-determined set of rules.
19. Remember that a bear market will give back in one month what a bull market has taken three months to build.
20. Don’t ever allow a big winning trade to turn into a loser. Stop yourself out if the market moves against you 20% from your peak profit point.
21. You must have a program, you must know your program, and you must follow your program.
22. Expect and accept losses gracefully. Those who brood over losses always miss the next opportunity, which more than likely will be profitable.
23. Split your profits right down the middle and never risk more than 50% of them again in the market.
24. The key to successful trading is knowing yourself and your stress point.
25. The difference between winners and losers isn’t so much native ability as it is discipline exercised in avoiding mistakes.
26. In trading as in fencing there are the quick and the dead.
27. Speech may be silver but silence is golden. Traders with the golden touch do not talk about their success.
28. Dream big dreams and think tall. Very few people set goals too high. A man becomes what he thinks about all day long.
29. Accept failure as a step towards victory.
30. Have you taken a loss? Forget it quickly. Have you taken a profit? Forget it even quicker! Don’t let ego and greed inhibit clear thinking and hard work.
31. One cannot do anything about yesterday. When one door closes, another door opens. The greater opportunity always lies through the open door.
32. The deepest secret for the trader is to subordinate his will to the will of the market. The market is truth as it reflects all forces that bear upon it. As long as he recognizes this he is safe. When he ignores this, he is lost and doomed.
33. It’s much easier to put on a trade than to take it off.
34. If a market doesn’t do what you think it should do, get out.
35. Beware of large positions that can control your emotions. Don’t be overly aggressive with the market. Treat it gently by allowing your equity to grow steadily rather than in bursts.
36. Never add to a losing position.
37. Beware of trying to pick tops or bottoms.
38. You must believe in yourself and your judgement if you expect to make a living at this game.
39. In a narrow market there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be – up or down.
40. A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong and not taking the loss – that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the soul.
41. Never volunteer advice and never brag of your winnings.
42. Of all speculative blunders, there are few greater than selling what shows a profit and keeping what shows a loss.
43. Standing aside is a position.
44. It is better to be more interested in the market’s reaction to new information than in the piece of news itself.

WE HAVE TO impose STRICT laws. 
NOBODY ABOVE THE LAW 
ALL agencies have done a lot 
In our country no one should go unfed 
Timely decisions help and we can face everything and become more strong 
Hence as lockdown started we got Yojana for port people 
In last 3 months 20 crore people were transferred 31000 crore 
9 cr farmers - 18000 crore was deposited 

But one more thing there is another big thing which has Alarmed all of us 
The whole fighting with corona - grains were given free 
And each family was given free 1 kg dal. 

In comparison to US we give more than 2.5 times free food 
12 times more than Britain 

Imp announcement I’m making 
During rainy season in our country 
In farming and agriculture we work more - and other sectors we get lazy 
Jul onwards festivals start pouring in 
And hence our expenses go high and keeping all this in mind hence we would use our PM kalyan mantri fund until NOV which means 80crore people will get free food for next 5 months. 
 ⁃ and each family will get 1kg chana free too along with ration 
 ⁃ 90000 crore would be spent 
 ⁃ 1.5 lakh crore would be spent overall 
 ⁃ For entire India - one ration card will be made 
 ⁃ “One nation one ration card” 
 ⁃ This will help those poor people who leave their villages to work in other states 
 ⁃ Today poor people and needy people of are getting food then two categories get the credit 
 ⁃ First farmers
 ⁃ And second to our loyal tax payers. 
 ⁃ I thank all from heart 
 ⁃ I’m coming days we will work more hard and continue to work with all safety precautions 
 ⁃ Self reliant 
 ⁃ And we will be VOCAL TO LOCAL 
 ⁃ We will work and move ahead too 
 ⁃ I pray and request that we all stay healthy , maintain 2 gaz ki duri and use masks and don’t let your guard down 

With this I pray for you 
And thank you"
