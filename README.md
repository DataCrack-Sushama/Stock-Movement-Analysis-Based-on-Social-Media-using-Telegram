# Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-using-Telegram
  
The Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts stock movements based on social media sentiment. By scraping data from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram, the model will analyze user-generated content, such as stock discussions and predictions, to forecast stock price trends.

##Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market sentiment derived from social media platforms. It utilizes data scraping techniques to gather relevant stock-related content and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods like sentiment analysis to predict stock trends. The machine learning model is then trained to predict future stock movements based on the processed data.

## Problem Statement
The stock market is influenced by various factors, including market news, investor sentiment, and external events. Public discussions about stocks on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram often influence market trends. The challenge is to predict stock price movements by analyzing the sentiment of social media posts and discussions.

## Motivation
Social media platforms provide a vast source of real-time discussions and opinions. By analyzing public sentiment about stocks, it is possible to predict price movements with higher accuracy. This model aims to bridge the gap between public sentiment and stock market behavior.

## Key Insights
- **Sentiment Impact**: Sentiment analysis can be a valuable tool to gauge public mood around a stock, affecting its future price trends.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Social media content provides real-time insights that can significantly influence stock movements in the short term.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The integration of sentiment analysis with stock price predictions can help investors and analysts make better-informed decisions.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For data scraping, processing, and model development.
- **BeautifulSoup/Scrapy/Selenium**: For web scraping and data collection.
- **NLTK/Spacy/TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis and text preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: Scrapes data from selected social media platform (Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment of posts (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Prediction Model**: Predicts stock movements based on social media discussions.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Step 2: Install Required Libraries Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

Data Sources
- Twitter API: Use Twitter's developer API to scrape tweets related to stock discussions.
- Reddit API: Use the Reddit API (PRAW) to scrape posts from relevant subreddits.
- Telegram API: Use Telegram's bot API to scrape relevant stock-related channels.

Usage
- Data Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and preprocess the scraped data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment in the data.
- Model Training: Train and test the machine learning model.
- Predict Stock Movements: Use the trained model to predict stock movements

Results
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Sentiment trends and their correlation with stock movements are visualized.
- Key features, such as frequency of mentions and sentiment polarity, are extracted and analyzed.
